I'm a 2nd year PhD student in statistical machine learning at [Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Yee Whye Teh](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/) and [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) and funded by [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/).

My research interests include causal inference and its applications in decision making. More specifically, I am interested in leveraging available observational data for robust decision making in the real world. I am also interested in distribution-free uncertainty quantification methods like conformal prediction and their applications in machine learning. Previously, I have worked on using causal inference for validating scientific simulator models.

Before my PhD, I worked for 2 years as an associate developer at [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/) in London. I got my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in mathematics from [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).
